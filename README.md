# twine

twine is the process layer of the Nisaba suite: the harness that
carries bale sessions between a planner and a worker, hosts the
sessions a model runs, and — later — spawns sessions from what the
office declares. Three faces, one core: the **courier** (moves bale's
four shapes and applies, relays and runs them), the **runtime** (hosts
a session: the model-call loop, the tool surface, the sandbox, window
accounting, the cost spine and kill-switch, the model adapters), and
the **scheduler** (reads the drafting-table, opens bundles, dispatches
to the runtime or to a person, enforces the cap). Headless; holds no
intent; rendered by the Nisaba shell.

**No code exists yet.** This repository holds the seed and its bale
configuration. Arc 1 (the courier) starts with session 1, which lands
`bin/twine`, the command registry and the bale pin, and decides the
layout. Until then there is nothing to run.

The spec lives in [`twine-seed.md`](twine-seed.md): identity, the
sitting's rulings (T1–T10), the carried inputs from tedder-src's
`harness-seed.md` (D1–D24, with this repo's status on each), the
runtime's design, the road (three arcs), and the open questions. Every
later answer about twine accretes there. The doc map is
[`claude/INDEX.md`](claude/INDEX.md).

Where twine sits: Nisaba is one shell over three cores with
dependencies pointing strictly downward — bale carries sessions and
depends on nothing; office declares what a session carries and holds
a project's progression, and depends on bale; twine drives bale's
verbs and reads office's declarations, and depends on both; the shell
renders all three and depends on twine only optionally. The diagram
and the definitions are `nisaba-seed.md` §1 in nisaba-src, which this
repository points at rather than copies.
